# Smart Traffic Management

It is an AI-powered Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Advanced Traffic Counting & Classification (ATCC) system. Leveraging Computer Vision and Deep Learning, it detects violations such as Helmet Detection, Triple Riding, Overspeeding, and Signal Jumping, thereby enhancing traffic surveillance and safety.

## Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to successfully deploy the SmartTraffic Management project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your VS Code terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RUBY02K/Smart_traffic_management.git
```

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory, open the terminal, and run:

```bash
  python app.py
```

Alternatively, you can directly use the "Run Python File" option for `app.py` in VS Code.

At this stage, the backend is set up and ready to handle requests from the frontend.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend Server

1. Open a new terminal by clicking the `+` icon at the top-right corner of the terminal window.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
  cd frontend
```

3. Start the frontend server using:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Once the frontend starts successfully, a host link will be displayed in the terminal. Click on it to access the application.

### Step 4: Login to the Application

Upon accessing the application, a login page will appear. Use the following credentials to log in:

Username: `user`  
Password: `pass`

After logging in, the main dashboard will be displayed, providing access to all traffic monitoring features.
